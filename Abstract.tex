This project focuses on developing a comprehensive system for tracking the stock market, predicting future price movements, and notifying users when their predefined goals align with market conditions. By leveraging external APIs for real-time stock data and historical trends, the system employs advanced machine learning algorithms, including LSTM, for price forecasting. It ensures scalability and reliability, with MongoDB managing time-series data and PostgreSQL handling user-related information. The system offers a user-friendly interface for tracking stocks, setting goals, and receiving customized alerts, empowering users to make informed investment decisions efficiently.
